    <p>My name is Samuel Fisher and I am a sophomore studying Business Management at BYU Idaho. I own a small business called Thrifted Lennons in Rexburg, which is where I spend the majority of my time outside of school. I have been married for the last year and a half to my beautiful wife Aliza, and we have a cat named Honey.</p>
