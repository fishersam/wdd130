        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose is to hit gnarly chops up on some rock bludgers and smack whiteskis.

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Here at Cowabunga Water Rafting we offer 3 levels of intensity for your group or family. Level 1 is geared towards riders ages 10 and up, perfect for families and beginners. Level 2 is geared towards ages 16 and up and requires a second safety meeting. Level 3 is geared towards ages 18 and up and is the most intense level that we currently offer. We only suggest choosing this level is you have completed a level 2 ride. Parties as large as 12 can fit on one ride for level 1 but only 8 are allowed in parties for level 2 and 3. Birthday parties must be booked 2 weeks in advance and all safety waivers and rental fees must be paid before arrival.</p>
